                <h3>2020 Summer Research Project: Predicting Incoming Union College Class Profiles using Machine Learning</h3>

                <h6 class="project-date"><i>June-August 2020</i></h6>
            
                <p>
                    In the summer of 2020, I conducted a research project through Union College to study the effectiveness of using various machine learning models to predict the probability of enrollment of Union applicants based on eight years of application data. Those probabilities are then used in aggregate to generate an expected class profile for the incoming class. The project was written in Python and primarily used the scikit-learn and pandas libraries to conduct data analysis. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    To prepare for the project, I used Tableau for exploratory data analysis (EDA), which helped me understand which trends in the data might be helpful to the predictive model. I also read <i>The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book</i> by Andriy Burkov to obtain exposure to the theory surrounding machine learning, then implemented what I read into the project. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I programmed the whole project myself, while receiving and implementing feedback from a Union Economics professor and a member of the Admissions staff as I developed the model. The work I did over the summer was successful: Admissions plans on using my model as a reference point for the 2021 applicant class. I am presently working to refine the model and prepare it for deployment. For more information on this project and an analysis of my findings from the summer, please visit <a href="https://digitalworks.union.edu/srps_2020/14/" target="_blank">the online publication of my summer research poster.</a>

                <h3>C++ Tutorial Series and Exploration</h3>

                <h6 class="project-date"><i>September-Novmeber 2020</i></h6>

                <p>
                    I am following an <a href="https://youtu.be/_bYFu9mBnr4">online C++ tutorial series</a>, through which I am learning the basics of the programming language and building up to developing an application. I had no experience in C++ prior to watching this series. I have been keeping a Google doc with my notes from the series, which serves as a place to keep track of all the things I find interesting or essential to the language.

                <p>
                    Following the completion of this series, I plan on working on a moderately large-scale C++ project to test my learning. I am leaning towards programming an AI to play a video game (a project that I have considered working on before), although I am still exploring ideas. I will update this page as I make progress on that project.
