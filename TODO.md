# To-Do List


## BEFORE LAUNCH

1. **Enhance presentation of "What will I be working on?" section of index page.** In particular, I would love to add some photos to each of the sections. At the very least, the section should be formatted such that the three sections are distinct. ***BONUS:*** It would be great to add an attractive link to my summer research poster to help explain the Admissions project. 

2. **Fix display of EON newsletter cards.** The text does not quite fill the card, and the cards are too big on mobile display. 

3. **Make website (roughly) mobile compatible.** There are a couple of specific things that need to be done for mobile compatibility: 
    1. Add margin between profile photo and intro video on `index.html`.
    2. Fix `blog.html` display (see above to-do).

## GENERAL

1. **Build heirarchy for blog page.** I want to create a page where I can write little articles either about what's going on in my life or various things that I have opinions on â€” the actual purpose of this page and its contents can be determined later, but I want to make the framework for this page regardless. It has become clear to me that it would be beneficial to separate different types of write-ups (e.g., one section on EON writings, one on general thoughts, one on code-related thoughts, etc.). There are a few different possibilities that I envision could accomplish this task:
    1. Dropdown menu from the navigation bar. Easy to implement.
    2. [Collapsible](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp) within page (i.e., one collapsible for each section). I really like this idea: something about it seems very aesthetically pleasing and professional to me.
    3. Folder system on page. Clicking on a folder (e.g., EON) would bring you to a new page with all of the contents (e.g., all of the newsletter writings).

2. **Imbed my GitHub contributions page.** I belive that the GitHub API would help me out here, but I would need to do a bit more research into this before I fully jump into it. I am also not sure where to put this; probably on `projects.html`, but I would want to implement it such that it flows with the style of the page and does not stick out too greatly. 

3. **Add transition to resume button.** Need to change code from changing background colors to changing opacity ([link](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_transition_hover.asp)).

4. **Replace feedback form with my own personal form.** While a Google Form is reliable, I would like to create my own form submission system from scratch so I could have more control of the presentation and overall process. There are a few potential spaces for this to be linked:
    1. On the bottom of `index.html`
    2. In the navbar (where it is presently linked)
    3. On the footer
    I wish to pick the method that is both most aesthetically pleasing and also, more importantly, the place where people would be most likely to see it.

5. **Experiment with removing bootstrap from local environment.** I have a hunch that this might be an acceptable step now that I use the jQuery loading screen.
