# To-Do List

1. **Add Google form for feedback.** There are a few ways this can be accomplished/potential spaces for this to be linked:
    1. On the bottom of `index.html`
    2. In the navbar
    3. On the footer
    I wish to pick the method that is both most aesthetically pleasing and also, more importantly, the place where people would be most likely to see it.

2. **Create page for blog/opinion writing.** I want to create a page where I can write little articles either about what's going on in my life or various things that I have opinions on â€” the actual purpose of this page and its contents can be determined later, but I want to make the framework for this page regardless. What I envision here is either: 
    1. A list of files/articles linked, each of which is a piece that I have written.
    2. A continuous page that includes every piece that I have written with the intention of use on the personal website. 

    I am thinking that the latter might be a better place to start, but the former is more conducive to lots of posts (i.e., something that should be implemented if I make many contributions to this page).

3. **Imbed my GitHub contributions page.** I belive that the GitHub API would help me out here, but I would need to do a bit more research into this before I fully jump into it. I am also not sure where to put this; probably on `projects.html`, but I would want to implement it such that it flows with the style of the page and does not stick out too greatly. 

4. **Create YouTube video for homepage.** This is the largest obstacle between now and the public release of the website.
