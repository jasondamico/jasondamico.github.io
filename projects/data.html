                <h3>2020 Summer Research Project: Predicting Incoming Union College Class Profiles using Machine Learning</h3>

                <h6 class="project-date"><i>June-December 2020</i></h6>

                <p>
                    In the summer of 2020, I conducted a research project through Union College to study the effectiveness of using various machine learning models to predict the probability of enrollment of Union applicants based on eight years of application data. Those probabilities are then used in aggregate to generate an expected class profile for the incoming class. The project was written in Python and primarily used the scikit-learn and pandas libraries to conduct data analysis.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To prepare for the project, I used Tableau for exploratory data analysis (EDA), which helped me understand which trends in the data might be helpful to the predictive model. I also read <i>The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book</i> by Andriy Burkov to obtain exposure to the theory surrounding machine learning, then implemented what I read into the project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I programmed the whole project myself, while receiving and implementing feedback from a Union Economics professor and a member of the Admissions staff as I developed the model. The work I did over the summer was successful: Admissions used my model as a reference point for the 2021 applicant class. I also created a script that allows the simulation to be run on a daily basis and creates a PDF summary report of the projected incoming class using the most recent data of which students were admitted to the College. For more information on this project and an analysis of my findings from the summer, please visit <a href="https://digitalworks.union.edu/srps_2020/14/" target="_blank">the online publication of my summer research poster.</a>

                <h3>NBA Data Analytics Project: MVP Predictor</h3>

                <h6 class="project-date"><i>December 2020-present</i></h6>

                <p>
                    To keep my data analytics skills sharp, I am currently pursuing a personal project analyzing NBA statistics. I am utilizing the <a href="https://www.balldontlie.io" target="_blank">balldontlie API</a> and <a href="https://basketball-reference.com" target="_blank">basketball-reference.com</a> to gather data from the last 20 NBA seasons: specifically, I am seeking out season average statistics (e.g., how many points LeBron James scores per game in the 2019-2020 season).
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am using the pandas, scikit-learn and matplotlib libraries to research and build a model to predict the MVP of the current NBA season based on the season average statistics of past winners. Since the season MVP is awarded based on a voting system, the model will predict a number of votes that each NBA player will receive rather than simply who will be given the award.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am presently in the preliminary stages of exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the project. Up until this point, I have been gathering and saving data from the above listed sources and preparing it for analysis.
