            <p>I built this website, without the assistance of a web development service, in response to taking a leave of absence from Union College for the 2020-2021 academic year. This website will be used to document what I accomplish during my leave of absence along with detailing my various accomplishment prior to that point. Specifically, it will be used to:</p>

        <div class="text-content home-page-content row">
            <h2 class="center" style="margin-bottom:10px">What will I be working on?</h2>

            <div class="loa-focus">
                <p>I plan on splitting up my time into three focuses, all of which I have great excitement for and expect to greatly aid my development. These three fields are as follows:</p>
            </div>

            <div class="loa-focus">
                <h4>Maine Boys to Men Internship</h4>
                <p>To continue to explore my passion of having productive conversations surrounding ending gender-based violence, I decided to pursue an internship with nonprofit organization <a href="https://www.maineboystomen.org/">Maine Boys to Men</a>, based in Falmouth, Maine. I was involved with the organization throughout high school and in my first year of college, and I am using my leave of absence to pursue my involvement with them to a greater extent than I ever have before. I am presently assisting the organization in moving their curriculum online, helping inform a local public school system on the best way to implement new sexual harassment policies, and providing feedback on existing curricula surrounding gender-based violence.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="loa-focus">
                <h4>Developing machine learning model for Union College Admissions</h4>
                <p>Continuing <a href="https://digitalworks.union.edu/srps_2020/14/" target="_blank">my summer research project from the summer of 2020</a>, I am working with Union College's Admissions department to develop a machine learning model based on their application data. The model is built to predict the probability of enrollment for a given applicant given the information they included when applying to the College, how many times they visited campus, etc. These predictions are, in turn, used to predict the incoming class profile to forecast the enrollment and finances of that class.</p>
                <p>This project will be used as a reference point in the College's 2021 Admissions cycle, and my work this fall is focused on refining the model for use. Specifically, I am continuing to improve the model's predictive performance and preparing an automation system that will run the model and produce a class profile on a weekly basis as the College receives more applicants.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Personal Learning and Development</h4>
            <p>Along with my professional positions, I will be continuing to extend my educator by pursuing various areas of academia that intrigue me. The overall goal is to gain knowledge that I would not have had neither the time nor the energy for if I was still balancing my regular courseload and the responsibilites of everyday life. I plan on hitting a vast range of topics throughout the duration of my leave of absence, but the areas that I am currently pursuing are as follows:</p>
            <div class="center">
                <div style="text-align:left;">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Taking a <a href="https://brilliant.org/courses/dynamics-bootcamp/" target="_blank">Brilliant.org course on classical mechanics</a></li>
                        <li>Learning C++ and pursuing related projects to cement concepts</li>
                        <li>Taking a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-1" target="_blank">Coursera course on Game Theory</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
