                <h3>Union College Event Calendar</h3>

                <h6 class="project-date"><i>January-April 2021</i></h6>

                <p>
                    In January of 2021, I was tasked with building a more modern-looking and accessible event dashboard for Union College's Admissions department. Before the beginning of the project and throughout the design process, I solicited feedback from the Admissions team on features that they wanted implemented. I drew proposed designs for the page and made proof-of-concept solutions before implementing the technical solution.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The solution I implemented uses <a href="https://technolutions.com/solutions/slate">Slate portal editor</a> and the <a href="https://fullcalendar.io/">FullCalendar JavaScript library</a> to display a JSON stream of event objects on a calendar that can be filtered by event type. I also created filter checkboxes such that the user can manipulate the events displayed, and I implemented the ability to change the filters that are selected by default depending on parameters passed to the URL. The page was used in production in March 2021, and prospective students for the class of 2025 used the page to sign up for admitted student events.

                <h3>Tick-Tock Robot</h3>

                <h6 class="project-date"><i>September-November 2019</i></h6>

                <p>
                    In my introductory engineering course (ESC 100) that I took in the fall of 2019 in my first year at Union College, myself and two project partners built the "Tick-Tock Robot" as our course project. The loose project requirement was to build a device that aids in a basic human function, so we decided to build a device that deals with modern humans' tendency to oversleep and need sensory stimuli to wake up. Our solution was to build an alarm clock on wheels. Our device functioned as a normal alarm clock: it would keep time, and the user could both adjust the current time and set the alarm. The device was equipped with a speaker, and LED display and individual flashing LEDs, such that when the alarm goes off, the clock moves to the other side of the room while flashing and making noise. The user then has to get up out of bed to chase down the clock and turn it off.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In designing the robot, we met a variety of design milestones, which included creating written proposals, SketchUp models and a styrofoam model of our final design. I primarily specialized in the electronic design and programming of the project: I designed the breadboard layout within the robot and I wrote Arduino code that allowed the robot to perform its functions and react to environmental interactions (button pushes and a distance sensor). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I used two Arduinos in the project: one signal sender (from button pushes, internal time and the distance sensor) and one signal receiver (updated LED display, started ringing alarm, etc.). To see the code I wrote for this project, please see the GitHub repository below:
