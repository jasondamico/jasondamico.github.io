            <p>This website will be used to document what I accomplish during my leave of absence for the 2020-2021 academic year. It will be used to:</p>

        <div class="text-content home-page-content row">
            <h2 class="center" style="margin-bottom:10px">What will I be working on?</h2>

            <p>As of August 2020, I plan on splitting up my time into three focuses, all of which I have great excitement for and expect to greatly aid my development. These three fields are as follows:</p>

            <h4>Maine Boys to Men Internship</h4>
            <p>To continue to explore my passion of having productive conversations surrounding ending gender-based violence, I decided to pursue an internship with nonprofit organization Maine Boys to Men, based in Falmouth, Maine. I was involved with the organization throughout high school and in my first year of college, and I am using my leave of absence to pursue my involvement with them to a greater extent than I ever have before.</p>

            <h4>Developing Machine Learning Model for Union College Admissions</h4>
            <p>Continuing <a href="https://digitalworks.union.edu/srps_2020/14/" target="_blank">my summer research project from the summer of 2020</a>, I am also working with Union College's Admissions department to develop a machine learning model based on their application data. The goal of the model is to predict the probability of enrollment for a given applicant given the information they included when applying to the College, how many times they visited campus, etc. These predictions are, in turn, used to create a prospective class profile to forecast the enrollment and finances of an incoming class.</p>
            <p>This project will be used as a reference point in the College's 2021 Admissions cycle, and my work this fall is focused on refining the model for use.</p>

            <h4>Personal Learning and Development</h4>
            <p>Possibly the field I am most excited about: I will be pursuing various areas of academia that intrigue me. The overall goal is to gain knowledge that I would not have had neither the time nor the energy for if I was balancing my regular courseload and the responsibilites of everyday life. I plan on hitting a vast range of topics throughout the duration of my leave of absence, but the areas that I am currently pursuing are as follows:</p>
            <div class="center">
                <div style="text-align:left;">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Taking a <a href="https://brilliant.org/courses/dynamics-bootcamp/" target="_blank">Brilliant course on classical mechanics</a></li>
                        <li>Learning C++, pursuing related projects to cement concepts</li>
                        <li>Taking a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-1" target="_blank">course on Game Theory</a></li>
