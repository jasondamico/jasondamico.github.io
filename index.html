            <h2 class="center" style="margin-bottom:10px">About Me</h2>

            <div>
                <p>I am a born-and-raised Mainer with a strong passion for engineering, math and computer science. I have spent my young professional career chasing after learning opportunities relating to these fields, with a focus on software development. Within software, I am currently most interested and experienced in web development, machine learning and data science. I am eager to continue expanding my skill set and continue to grow as a developer.</p>
                
                <p>I also have a deep passion for gender-based violence advocacy and examining the traditional gender roles society imposes. I maintain a strong, male-identified voice acting to end male violence against women by looking critically at masculinity and providing a space for open conversations surrounding this issue in both my personal life and my professional life.</p>

            <h2 class="center" style="margin-bottom:10px">Website Purpose</h2>

            <p>I built this website, without the assistance of a web development service, to document my experience and detail my accomplishments up to this point in my life. Specifically, the website will be used to:</p> 
            <div class="center">

                        <li>Supply progress reports on various projects that I take on</li>
                        <li>Chronicle my professional and personal growth</li>

        <div class="text-content home-page-content row">
            <h2 class="center" style="margin-bottom:10px">What am I working on right now?</h2>

            <div class="focuses">
                <p>I am currently splitting up my time into three focuses, all of which I have great excitement about. These three fields are as follows:</p>
            </div>

            <div class="focuses">
                <h4>Maine Boys to Men Internship</h4>
                <p>To continue to explore my passion of having productive conversations surrounding ending gender-based violence, I decided to pursue an internship with nonprofit organization <a href="https://www.maineboystomen.org/">Maine Boys to Men</a>, based in Falmouth, Maine. I was involved with the organization throughout high school and in my first year of college, and as an intern, I am now involved with them to a greater extent than I ever have been before. I am presently assisting the organization in moving their curriculum online, helping inform a local public school system on the best way to implement new sexual harassment policies, and providing feedback on existing curricula surrounding gender-based violence.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="focuses">
                <h4>Developing a machine learning model for Union College Admissions</h4>
                <p>Continuing <a href="https://digitalworks.union.edu/srps_2020/14/" target="_blank">my research project from the summer of 2020</a>, I am working with Union College's Admissions department to develop a machine learning model based on their past application data. The model is built to predict the probability of enrollment for a given applicant provided the information they supplied when applying to the College, how many times they visited campus, etc. These predictions are, in turn, used to predict the incoming class profile to forecast the enrollment and finances of that class. Please see <a href="/code.html">the "Coding Projects" page</a> for more information on this project.</p> 
                <p>This project will be used as a reference point in the College's 2021 Admissions cycle, and my work this fall is focused on refining the model for use. Specifically, I am continuing to improve the model's predictive performance and preparing an automation system that will run the model and produce a class profile on a weekly basis as the College receives more applicants.</p>
            </div>

            <h4>Personal learning and development</h4>
            <p>Along with my professional positions, I will be continuing to expand my knowledge by pursuing various areas of academia that intrigue me. The areas that I am currently pursuing are as follows:</p>
            <div class="center">
                <div style="text-align:left;">
                    <ul>
                        <li>A <a href="https://brilliant.org/courses/dynamics-bootcamp/" target="_blank">Brilliant.org course on classical mechanics</a></li>
                        <li>Learning C++ and pursuing related projects to cement concepts</li>
                        <li>A <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-1" target="_blank">Coursera course on game theory</a></li>
