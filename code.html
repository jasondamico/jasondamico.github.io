                <h3>Union College Event Calendar</h3>

                <h6 class="project-date"><i>January-April 2021</i></h6>

                <p>
                    In January of 2021, I was tasked with building a more modern-looking and accessible event dashboard for Union College's Admissions department. Before the beginning of the project and throughout the design process, I solicited feedback from the Admissions team on features that they wanted implemented. I drew proposed designs for the page and made proof-of-concept solutions before implementing the technical solution.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The solution I implemented uses <a href="https://technolutions.com/solutions/slate">Slate portal editor</a> and the <a href="https://fullcalendar.io/">FullCalendar JavaScript library</a> to display a JSON stream of event objects on a calendar that can be filtered by event type. I also created filter checkboxes such that the user can manipulate the events displayed, and I implemented the ability to change the filters that are selected by default depending on parameters passed to the URL. The page was used in production in March 2021, and prospective students for the class of 2025 used the page to sign up for admitted student events.

                <h3>2020 Summer Research Project: Predicting Incoming Union College Class Profiles using Machine Learning</h3>

                <h6 class="project-date"><i>June-December 2020</i></h6>
            
                <p>
                    In the summer of 2020, I conducted a research project through Union College to study the effectiveness of using various machine learning models to predict the probability of enrollment of Union applicants based on eight years of application data. Those probabilities are then used in aggregate to generate an expected class profile for the incoming class. The project was written in Python and primarily used the scikit-learn and pandas libraries to conduct data analysis. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    To prepare for the project, I used Tableau for exploratory data analysis (EDA), which helped me understand which trends in the data might be helpful to the predictive model. I also read <i>The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book</i> by Andriy Burkov to obtain exposure to the theory surrounding machine learning, then implemented what I read into the project. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I programmed the whole project myself, while receiving and implementing feedback from a Union Economics professor and a member of the Admissions staff as I developed the model. The work I did over the summer was successful: Admissions used my model as a reference point for the 2021 applicant class. I also created a script that allows the simulation to be run on a daily basis and creates a PDF summary report of the projected incoming class using the most recent data of which students were admitted to the College.

                <h3>NBA Data Analytics Project: MVP Predictor</h3>

                <h6 class="project-date"><i>December 2020-present</i></h6>
            
                <p>
                    To keep my data analytics skills sharp, I am currently pursuing a personal project analyzing NBA statistics. I am utilizing the <a href="https://www.balldontlie.io" target="_blank">balldontlie API</a> and <a href="https://basketball-reference.com" target="_blank">basketball-reference.com</a> to gather data from the last 20 NBA seasons: specifically, I am seeking out season average statistics (e.g., how many points LeBron James scores per game in the 2019-2020 season).
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am using the pandas, scikit-learn and matplotlib libraries to research and build a model to predict the MVP of the current NBA season based on the season average statistics of past winners. Since the season MVP is awarded based on a voting system, the model will predict a number of votes that each NBA player will receive rather than simply who will be given the award. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am presently in the preliminary stages of exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the project. Up until this point, I have been gathering and saving data from the above listed sources and preparing it for analysis.

                <h3>Tick-Tock Robot</h3>

                <h6 class="project-date"><i>September-November 2019</i></h6>

                <p>
                    In my introductory engineering course (ESC 100) that I took in the fall of 2019 in my first year at Union College, myself and two project partners built the "Tick-Tock Robot" as our course project. The loose project requirement was to build a device that aids in a basic human function, so we decided to build a device that deals with modern humans' tendency to oversleep and need sensory stimuli to wake up. Our solution was to build an alarm clock on wheels. Our device functioned as a normal alarm clock: it would keep time, and the user could both adjust the current time and set the alarm. The device was equipped with a speaker, and LED display and individual flashing LEDs, such that when the alarm goes off, the clock moves to the other side of the room while flashing and making noise. The user then has to get up out of bed to chase down the clock and turn it off.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In designing the robot, we met a variety of design milestones, which included creating written proposals, SketchUp models and a styrofoam model of our final design. I primarily specialized in the electronic design and programming of the project: I designed the breadboard layout within the robot and I wrote Arduino code that allowed the robot to perform its functions and react to environmental interactions (button pushes and a distance sensor). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I used two Arduinos in the project: one signal sender (from button pushes, internal time and the distance sensor) and one signal receiver (updated LED display, started ringing alarm, etc.). To see the code I wrote for this project, please see the GitHub repository below:
