                                        On July 29, a cohort of your favorite CEOs — Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Google — testified (virtually) in front of the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee. So what’s the deal: why did it happen, what did they talk about, and why is it important?

                                    <p id="card-body" style="font-family: sans-serif;  font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px; padding-right: 3%; padding-left: 3%;">

                                    <p id="card-body" style="font-family: sans-serif;  font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px; padding-right: 3%; padding-left: 3%;">
                                        Big tech companies, namely the ones represented in the most recent hearing, have been the subject of outcry recently relating to using their high influence in current society to stifle their competitors and expand their empires. According to the FTC, antitrust laws have the objective “to protect the process of competition for the benefit of consumers” (check out <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/antitrust-laws">this link</a> if you are interested in reading more about the relevant laws as described by the FTC). 
                                    </p>

                                    <p id="card-body" style="font-family: sans-serif;  font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 35px; padding-right: 3%; padding-left: 3%;">
                                        Take Facebook, for example: remember when they bought Instagram back in 2012? Well, if the subcommittee determines that Facebook used its influence over the social media market to threaten running Instagram out of business unless they agreed to an acquisition deal (as the general public suspects that they did), that would be illegal in the eyes of antitrust law. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p id="card-body" style="font-family: sans-serif;  font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px; padding-right: 3%; padding-left: 3%;">
                                        <b>What did they talk about?</b>
                                    </p>

                                    <p id="card-body" style="font-family: sans-serif;  font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px; padding-right: 3%; padding-left: 3%;">
                                        While this was merely a hearing and no punishments were handed out, the hearing showed how prepared the subcommittee is to bring the hammer down. The companies were confronted with questions surrounding using insider information and financial leverage to expand. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p id="card-body" style="font-family: sans-serif;  font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px; padding-right: 3%; padding-left: 3%;">
                                        A particular focus was taken on the ever-important question of using private user data: the subcommittee attempted to pin down CEOs on exactly how much private information they take from their users and use to increase profits. The CEOs often floundered when directly asked about actions that violate antitrust laws and, generally speaking, the hearing is a great start to approaching slowing down Big Tech’s dominance.
                                    </p>

                                        <b>Why is it important?</b>
                                    </p>

                                    <p id="card-body" style="font-family: sans-serif;  font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px; padding-right: 3%; padding-left: 3%;">
                                        According to several tech analysts, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/30/21346575/tech-antitrust-hearing-recap-bezos-zuckerberg-cook-pichai">this antitrust hearing was relatively productive.</a> Controlling Big Tech and what they do with our data is a massive issue that seems nearly impossible to tackle, but this hearing certainly got the ball rolling. One interesting thing is the diversity of the companies represented and the services they offer: this hearing wasn’t just about Google’s search algorithm or Facebook’s control over social networking, or even about protecting user data. Rather, it was about stopping technology companies from using their massive power to unethically influence the lives of their consumers or illegally stop tech innovators in their tracks. 
                                    </p>

                                    <p id="card-body" style="font-family: sans-serif;  font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px; padding-right: 3%; padding-left: 3%;">
                                        The big thing to look out for is the subcommittee’s report on the hearing, which is expected to come out in a couple of weeks and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2020/08/11/the-tech-antitrust-hearings-are-over-whats-next-for-enforcement/"> could have massive implications on the future of these companies:</a> they could recommend splitting any of the companies up, encourage legal actions against them, etc. The response to this hearing could alter the trajectory of these companies and the influence they have on our lives. It’s likely that any incoming sanctions would not go into effect in the near future, but rather would begin a slow transition into more lawful practices. Change may not be coming rapidly, but it’s certainly on the horizon.
