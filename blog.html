                            I always wanted to get into listening to podcasts, but never found the time to do so. The pandemic has presented the <i>perfect</i> opportunity for me to deep dive into the world of podcasts. Whether you’re back on campus or learning remotely, the abundance of free time that we all still have is the perfect time for listening. It’s a great activity to relax but still keep your mind active.
                        </p>

                        <p id="card-body" style="font-family: sans-serif;  font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px; padding-right: 3%; padding-left: 3%;">
                            The key is to find the right podcast: the perfect blend of relaxation and positive content. Listening to podcasts with an entrepreneurial perspective isn’t all about listening to business-related podcasts, it’s about picking up new learning to better yourself and expand your mind. Don’t know where to start? No need to worry, your friends at EON have culminated a list of podcasts for you to use to wind down and better yourself!

                            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: 10%;"><i><b>How I Built This with Guy Raz.</b></i> An absolute essential for podcast listeners who have an entrepreneurial interest. Host Guy Raz interviews entrepreneurs and business owners from a wide range of industries, who provide commentary on the decisions they made to bring their ideas forward into the world. Great listen for those looking for inspiring stories of triumph, innovation and overcoming challenges.</li>

                            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: 10%;"><i><b>On Purpose with Jay Shetty.</b></i> This podcast is a change of pace from the others on this list: Shetty hosts conversations surrounding wellness and self-improvement. The honesty and vulnerability of the conversations here lead to incredible growth and introspection.</li>

                            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: 10%;"><i><b>Code Switch.</b></i> This podcast from NPR provides incredible commentary on race in our society. Some episodes are informative highlights of lesser-known racial justice movements (such as the San Francisco State College protests of 1968) and some episodes analyze major acts of discrimination. This podcast will be sure to deepen your knowledge surrounding race-based issues, a key aspect of becoming a better human (and, therefore, a better entrepreneur).</li>

                            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: 10%;"><i><b>Ologies with Alie Ward.</b></i> Alie Ward creates the perfect atmosphere for comical, but intellectual discussion surrounding obscure branches of science. A recent reviewer called the podcast an “educational hug,” which is an excellent description. Ologies is very easy to digest: after each episode, you will feel just as educated as you are entertained. For a charming, fun podcast that will give you more expertise than you thought possible in all sorts of interesting things (take <a href="https://www.alieward.com/ologies/dasyurology">a recent episode on Tazmanian devils</a>, for instance), look no further.</li>
                            
                            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: 10%;"><i><b>This Week in Tech (TWiT).</b></i> TWiT is a comprehensive, friendly report on the state of the tech industry. The podcast is more focused on the broad trajectory of technology, its various advancements and what this means for society as we know it. In an increasingly automated and tech-driven world, the good folks at TWiT will help guide you and keep you informed. </li>

                            On July 29, a cohort of your favorite CEOs — Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Google — testified (virtually) in front of the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee. So what’s the deal: why did it happen, what did they talk about, and why is it important?
                        </p>

                        <p id="card-body" style="font-family: sans-serif;  font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px; padding-right: 3%; padding-left: 3%;">
                            <b>Why did it happen?</b>
                        </p>

                        <p id="card-body" style="font-family: sans-serif;  font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px; padding-right: 3%; padding-left: 3%;">
                            Big tech companies, namely the ones represented in the most recent hearing, have been the subject of outcry recently relating to using their high influence in current society to stifle their competitors and expand their empires. According to the FTC, antitrust laws have the objective “to protect the process of competition for the benefit of consumers” (check out <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/antitrust-laws">this link</a> if you are interested in reading more about the relevant laws as described by the FTC). 
                        </p>

                        <p id="card-body" style="font-family: sans-serif;  font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 35px; padding-right: 3%; padding-left: 3%;">
                            Take Facebook, for example: remember when they bought Instagram back in 2012? Well, if the subcommittee determines that Facebook used its influence over the social media market to threaten running Instagram out of business unless they agreed to an acquisition deal (as the general public suspects that they did), that would be illegal in the eyes of antitrust law. 
                        </p>

                        <p id="card-body" style="font-family: sans-serif;  font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px; padding-right: 3%; padding-left: 3%;">
                            <b>What did they talk about?</b>
                        </p>

                        <p id="card-body" style="font-family: sans-serif;  font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px; padding-right: 3%; padding-left: 3%;">
                            While this was merely a hearing and no punishments were handed out, the hearing showed how prepared the subcommittee is to bring the hammer down. The companies were confronted with questions surrounding using insider information and financial leverage to expand. 
                        </p>

                        <p id="card-body" style="font-family: sans-serif;  font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px; padding-right: 3%; padding-left: 3%;">
                            A particular focus was taken on the ever-important question of using private user data: the subcommittee attempted to pin down CEOs on exactly how much private information they take from their users and use to increase profits. The CEOs often floundered when directly asked about actions that violate antitrust laws and, generally speaking, the hearing is a great start to approaching slowing down Big Tech’s dominance.
                        </p>

                        <p id="card-body" style="font-family: sans-serif;  font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 35px; padding-right: 3%; padding-left: 3%;">

                            <b>Why is it important?</b>

                        <p id="card-body" style="font-family: sans-serif;  font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px; padding-right: 3%; padding-left: 3%;">
                            According to several tech analysts, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/30/21346575/tech-antitrust-hearing-recap-bezos-zuckerberg-cook-pichai">this antitrust hearing was relatively productive.</a> Controlling Big Tech and what they do with our data is a massive issue that seems nearly impossible to tackle, but this hearing certainly got the ball rolling. One interesting thing is the diversity of the companies represented and the services they offer: this hearing wasn’t just about Google’s search algorithm or Facebook’s control over social networking, or even about protecting user data. Rather, it was about stopping technology companies from using their massive power to unethically influence the lives of their consumers or illegally stop tech innovators in their tracks. 
                        </p>

                        <p id="card-body" style="font-family: sans-serif;  font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0; Margin-bottom: 15px; padding-right: 3%; padding-left: 3%;">
                            The big thing to look out for is the subcommittee’s report on the hearing, which is expected to come out in a couple of weeks and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2020/08/11/the-tech-antitrust-hearings-are-over-whats-next-for-enforcement/"> could have massive implications on the future of these companies:</a> they could recommend splitting any of the companies up, encourage legal actions against them, etc. The response to this hearing could alter the trajectory of these companies and the influence they have on our lives. It’s likely that any incoming sanctions would not go into effect in the near future, but rather would begin a slow transition into more lawful practices. Change may not be coming rapidly, but it’s certainly on the horizon.
