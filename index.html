            <div>
                <p>I am a born-and-raised Mainer with a strong passion for engineering, math and computer science. I have spent my young professional career chasing after learning opportunities relating to these fields, with a focus on software development. Within software, I am currently most interested and experienced in web development, machine learning and data science. I am eager to continue expanding my skill set and continue to grow as a developer.</p>
                
                <p>I also have a deep passion for gender-based violence advocacy and examining the traditional gender roles society imposes. I maintain a strong, male-identified voice acting to end male violence against women by looking critically at masculinity and providing a space for open conversations surrounding this issue in both my personal life and my professional life.</p>

            <p>I built this website, without the assistance of a web development service, to document my experience and detail my accomplishments up to this point in my life. Specifically, the website will be used to:</p>

            <div class="focuses">
                <p>At the beginning of June 2021, I began a remote position as a <b>Data Science <a href="https://www.codingitforward.com/civic-digital-fellowship">Civic Digital Fellow</a> with the General Services Administration (GSA)</b>. Over the course of this summer, I will be working within the President's Management Agenda team, which focuses on reporting on and assessing the performance of government agencies based on the expectations outlined by the sitting president's administration. I will be focusing on a capstone project for the summer and will provide additional support for the team in other areas involving data science.</p>

                <h4>Maine Boys to Men Internship</h4>
                <p>To continue to explore my passion of having productive conversations surrounding ending gender-based violence, I decided to pursue an internship with nonprofit organization <a href="https://www.maineboystomen.org/">Maine Boys to Men</a>, based in Falmouth, Maine. I was involved with the organization throughout high school and in my first year of college, and as an intern, I am now involved with them to a greater extent than I ever have been before. I am presently assisting the organization in moving their programs online, helping inform a local public school system on the best way to implement new sexual harassment policies, and providing feedback on existing curricula surrounding gender-based violence.</p>
